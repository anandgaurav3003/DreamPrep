    <h1><u>Syllabus</u></h1>
    <h2 id="title">UPSC</h2>
    <u><h3 id="heading"><b>SECTION I : PLAN OF EXAMINATION</b></h3></u>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Civil Services Examination comprises two successive stages:<br></b>
        <b>(i)</b> Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination (Objective Type) for the selection of candidates for Civil 
        Services (Main) Examination;<br>
        <b>(ii)</b> Civil Services (Main) Examination (Written and Interview/Personality Test) for the selection of 
        candidates for the various Services and posts.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> The Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination will consist of two papers of Objective type (multiple 
            choice questions) and carry a maximum of 400 marks in the subjects set out in sub-section (A) of Section 
            II. This examination is meant to serve as a screening test only; the marks obtained in the Civil Services 
            (Preliminary) Examination by the candidates who are declared qualified for admission to the Civil Services 
            (Main) Examination will not be counted for determining their final order of merit. The number of 
            candidates to be admitted to the Civil Services (Main) Examination will be about twelve to thirteen times 
            the total approximate number of vacancies to be filled in the year through this Examination. Only those 
            candidates who are declared by the Commission to have qualified in the Civil Services (Preliminary) 
            Examination in the year will be eligible for admission to the Civil Services (Main) Examination of that year 
            provided they are otherwise eligible for admission to the Civil Services (Main) Examination.<br><br>
            <b>Note I :</b> The Commission will draw a list of candidates to be qualified for Civil Services (Main) Examination 
            based on the criterion of minimum qualifying marks of 33% in General Studies Paper-II of Civil Services 
            (Preliminary) Examination and total qualifying marks of General Studies Paper-I of Civil Services 
            (Preliminary) Examination as may be determined by the Commission.<br>
            <b>Note II :</b> There will be negative marking for incorrect answers as detailed below : <br>
            (i) There are four alternatives for the answers to every question. For each question for which a wrong 
            answer has been given by the candidate, one-third (0.33) of the marks assigned to that question 
            will be deducted as penalty.<br>
            (ii) If a candidate gives more than one answer, it will be treated as a wrong answer even if one of the 
            given answers happen to be correct and there will be same penalty as above for that question.<br>
            (iii) If a question is left blank i.e. no answer is given by the candidate, there will be no penalty for that 
            question.</p><br>

            <p><b>3.</b>     The Civil Services (Main) Examination will consist of a Written Examination and an 
                Interview/Personality Test. The Written Examination will consist of 9 papers of conventional essay type in 
                the subjects set out in sub-section (B) of Section-II out of which two papers will be of qualifying in nature. 
                [Also see Note (ii) under Para-I of Section II-(B)]. Marks obtained for all the compulsory papers (Paper-I to 
                Paper-VII) and Marks obtained in Interview/Personality Test will be counted for ranking.<br><br>
                <b>4.1</b> Candidates who obtain such minimum qualifying marks in the written part of the Civil Services 
                (Main) Examination as may be fixed by the Commission at their discretion, shall be summoned by them 
                for an Interview/Personality Test, vide sub-section (C) of Section-II. The number of candidates to be 
                summoned for Interview/Personality Test will be about twice of the number of vacancies to be filled. The 
                Interview/Personality Test will carry 275 marks (with no minimum qualifying marks).<br>
                <b>4.2</b> Marks thus obtained by the candidates in the Civil Services (Main) Examination (Written part as well 
                as Interview/Personality Test) would determine their final ranking. Candidates will be allotted to the 
                various Services keeping in view their ranks in the examination and the preferences expressed by them for 
                the various Services and posts</p><br>
